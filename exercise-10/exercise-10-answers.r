# 1. Access a dataset
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Recode some variables
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Write a multiple linear regression model
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Interpret regression results
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# [QUESTION 4.1] Do females report higher religious attendance than males,
#                independently of age, employment status, marital status or
#                subjective income? (Answer Yes or No.)

# [QUESTION 4.2] Does the model support the view that economic insecurity
#                increases religious attendance?

# [QUESTION 4.3] How do you interpret the interaction in the model?

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Diagnose a linear regression model
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# [QUESTION 5] According to its residuals, how biased is the model, and what
#              does that mean _in terms of its capacity to predict religious
#              attendance_ from our list of predictors?

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Start thinking beyond 'flat' models
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# [QUESTION 6.1] Report the country-level effect for Poland. (Answer with a single 
#                number, rounded up to 1-digit precision.)

# [QUESTION 6.2] Can you explain why I am asking you to include country of
#                residence as a predictor, and if so, what kind of modelling
#                strategy is being suggested to you here?

# You are done -- thank you for your efforts!
