# DSR: Exercise 2

This exercise focuses on getting familiar with R syntax, especially when it becomes a bit weird.

Simply open the script in RStudio and go through it, trying to answer the questions that you find on the way.

_Note to self: this script might need better comments, and a separate exercise (and answer) sheet. Ideally, it would cover as much ground as [Mhairi McNeill][mmn]'s excellent [base R cheatsheet][r-cheatsheet]._
