# DSR: Exercise 12 (graded)

This exercise does not involve writing code, but instead focuses on reflecting upon what you did over the course of the semester in this course, and what you make out of it at that stage.

## Scenario

You are a social science student interested in applying to positions that list various skill sets, including, but not limited to,

- econometrics
- data science
- machine learning
- quantitative analysis
- statistics

(We discussed some real-world examples of such positions over the semester. You are welcome to mention other such internship offers in your answer to this exercise, and to include them as PDF attachments.)

## Instructions

- List the specific __coding skills__ that you deem most useful to performing data science for people with _your_ profile.
- List the __practical heuristics__ that you developed throughout the term in order to find solutions to your coding problems.
- If you identified particularly __relevant packages__ outside those cited in the course material, mention them.
- Discuss _some_ of the __course readings and videos__, explaining how they helped (or not) with learning those skills.

Please limit your answer to a __single page__ of roughly __4-5 paragraphs__ at most.

## Explainer

As you have understood by now, this is a 'meta-exercise' that gives you a chance to submit feedback on the course content. It does _not_ replace the final (anonymous) feedback that you will be able to provide at the very end of the course.

- The part on coding skills is about your own, personal experience with data science. I am interested in collecting a final round of information on your own profiles as social scientists in training, on how you interpret that training, and on what professional opportunities you intend to pursue.

- The part on practical heuristics is a way for me to learn more on your problem-solving and Web search skills. When working on the course exercises, what useful resources did you discover beyond the course material? What was helpful to you, at your current level of practice?

- The part on R packages is yet another way for me to understand what you found useful while working on the course exercises, and possibly on the assignments of other R-based courses that you might have taken in the past, or are taking right now. This part is optional (read the instructions again: '_If_…').

- Last, the part on the course readings and videos is basically a way for me to collect feedback [on the course syllabus](https://twitter.com/emayfarris/status/1652652023597215749). It will help me calibrate the readings for future iterations of the course, and might also help me to adjust the content of some of the course sessions to your needs and interests.

Note: do not hesitate to speak both individually and as a group in your text, as in "collectively, we felt…" or as "one of us (Viktoria) also used…"

I hope you will find this exercise interesting. You might want to treat it as a simulation exercise of you reporting on the course as if had been some kind of data analysis internship, during which you trained some technical skills, and on which you are now being asked to perform what amounts to an impact assessment.

## Submission instructions

Please [email me](mailto:francois.briatte@sciencespo.fr) your group's answers as a single PDF document called `exercise-12-Group-01.pdf`, where `01` is your group number, as stated in the groups spreadsheet on Google Drive.

Please send me that email __along with your answer to Exercise 11, before our last class together__.

You do _not_ need to also attach the data and/or the rest of the `exercise-12` folder -- the answers will be enough.

Use the email subject __"DSR: Answers to Exercises 11 and 12, Group 01"__, where `01` once again designates your group number. That information should also appear at the top of your script, in the code header.

Thanks a lot for your work!
