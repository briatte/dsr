# DSR: Exercise 12 (graded)

This exercise does not involve writing code, but instead focuses on reflecting upon what you did over the course of the semester in this course, and what you make out of it at that stage.

## Scenario

You are a social science student interested in aplying to positions that list various skill sets, including, but not limited to,

- econometrics
- data science
- machine learning
- quantitative analysis
- statistics

(We discussed some real-world examples of such positions over the semester. You are welcome to mention other such internship offers in your answer to this exercise, and to include them as PDF attachments.)

## Instructions

- List the specific __coding skills__ that you deem most useful to performing data science for people with your profile.
- Discuss some of the __course readings__, explaining how you believe they helped (or not) with learning those skills.
- If you identified particularly __relevant packages__ outside those cited in the course material, mention them.

Please limit your answer to a __single page__ of roughly __3-4 paragraphs__ at most.

## Submission instructions

Please [email me](mailto:francois.briatte@sciencespo.fr) your group's answers as a single PDF document called `exercise-12-Group-01.pdf`, where `01` is your group number, as stated in the groups spreadsheet on Google Drive.

Please send me that email __at most 10 days after the class during which you received this exercise__.

Use the email subject __"DSR: Answer to Exercise 12, Group 01"__, where `01` once again designates your group number. That information should also appear at the top of your document.
