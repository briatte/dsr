The [Katowice 2018][kato18] speech is present twice in the `data` folder: once as a PDF file, which comes from [ESM 244 Lab Week 8][esm244-lab8], and once as a plain text file, as found at the source above.

I did not research the [EESC event][eesc19] enough to confirm that it was held in Brussels, but given that it was an EU event, I think it is safe to assume that it did.
