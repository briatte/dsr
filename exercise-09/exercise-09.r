# 1. Access a dataset
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Create new variables
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# [QUESTION 2.1] Average number of days until school closures
# [QUESTION 2.2] Average number of days until lockdown

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Describe the data
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# [QUESTION 3.1] Number of countries where school closure occurred before
#                national lockdown
# [QUESTION 3.2] Linear correlation coefficient between time to national
#                lockdown and population

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Model a linear relationship
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# [QUESTION 4.1] According to you, which model performs best, and why?
# [QUESTION 4.2] How do you interpret the coefficient for Covid-19 cases?

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Diagnose a linear regression model
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# [QUESTION 5.1] On average, by how many days does the best model get time to
#                national lockdown wrong?
# [QUESTION 5.2] According to that model, in which three countries are Covid-19
#                cases and population size the least predictive of time to
#                national lockdown?

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Formulate a prediction
