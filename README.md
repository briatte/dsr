`>` __[Syllabus](#)__ (in the works)

This repo contains files from an old course project that took 5 years to actually get taught. I'm giving it a go this semester, so all old content is gone, and will be replaced, if everything goes well, by some new sessions.

A provisional outline follows. Ideally, we'd also find time for a session to wrap up and to introduce tools that are not covered here. By order of priority: SQL, Git/GitHub, R Markdown, and possibly some JavaScript visualization libraries.

# Part 1. Basics

## 1. Software

R and RStudio.

## 2. Workflow

Projects, folders, code.

## 3. Data

Data wrangling, mostly through `dplyr`.

## 4. Visualization

Mostly `ggplot2`.

# Part 2. Essentials

## 5. Description

Also covering sampling.

## 6. Association

Also covering surveys.

## 7. Correlation

Also introducing least squares.

## 8. Regression

Linear, with diagnostics.

## 9. Nonlinearity

Logistic regression, mostly.

## 10. Classification

Dimensionality reduction.

# Part 3. Extras

## 11. Text
## 12. Maps
