# `>` Introduction to Data Science with R

`>` __[Syllabus](https://f.briatte.org/teaching/syllabus-dsr.pdf)__

This repo contains files from an old course project that took 5 years to actually get taught. I'm giving it a go this semester, so all old content is gone, and will be replaced, if everything goes well, by some new sessions.

A provisional outline follows. Ideally, we'd also find time for a session to wrap up and to introduce tools that are not covered here. By order of priority: SQL, Git/GitHub, R Markdown, and possibly some JavaScript visualization libraries.

This folder contains the code, data and documentation of the examples used either during the practice sessions in class, or distributed as homework exercises. __Slides are hosted elsewhere, and the links are not currently active.__

# Part 1. Basics

## 1. Software

R and RStudio.

# Credits

The last time I had a chance to build such a course was [10 years ago, with Ivaylo Petev](https://f.briatte.org/teaching/ida/). Some of the inspiration for this course dates back to that time.
