The post contains a figure and the corresponding equation for it:

> _Incumbent Party Margin_ = 9.93 + 5.48 × _Income Growth_ – 1.76 × _Years in Office_

The demo session for today replicates the model and the figure that comes with it (although the figure in the post uses a different coefficient for _Years in office_).

See also Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, _[Democracy for Realists][dfr]_, Princeton University Press, 2016, ch. 6, or the conference paper cited in the blog post.

The `bartels4812` dataset is taken from data sent to me by Larry Bartels in a personal communication on 30 March 2013 (thanks).

The `presidents4820` dataset is a personal addition based on Wikipedia entries for each presidential election.
